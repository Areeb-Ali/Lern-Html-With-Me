    <!-- HTML Tags are the building blocks of web pages. They define the structure, content, and formatting of the page. Here's a breakdown of the tags mentioned:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration specifies the document type to the browser, indicating that it's an HTML5 document.
<html>: This tag represents the root of an HTML document.
<head>: This section contains meta-information about the HTML page, such as the title, stylesheets, scripts, and more.
<title>: This tag defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar.
<body>: This section contains the visible content of the HTML page, including text, images, links, and other elements.
<h1> to <h6>: These tags define six levels of headings, from most important (<h1>) to least important (<h6>).
<br>: This tag inserts a line break.
<hr>: This tag creates a horizontal rule.
<b>: This tag makes text bold.
<i>: This tag makes text italic.
<sup>: This tag creates superscript text.
<sub>: This tag creates subscript text.
<center>: This tag centers the content within it (although it is generally discouraged in modern web design). -->
